# WeatherHere: React.js Weather App

## The Technologies Used

This is a web application built with React.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and AWS S3.

## An Overview of the Application

This app retrieves a user's local weather data through WeatherAPI.com's api using their geolocation. It also allows the user to choose any other city in the world, which involves utilizing the Google Places Autocomplete API for city selection with minimal validation necessary.

For any location selected, the user receives all of the regular weather data that you'd come to expect (ex: main temperature, high and low, hourly/daily forecasts, miscellaneous data like humidity/wind/UV index).
